                <p>
                    ‘Nayi Raahein’ is an intensive forty eight hour workshops to be held
                    in the school premises. This is our first engagement with these young
                    people and there are further structured programmes which are aimed at
                    helping youth understand themselves and their communities better and
                    emerge as leaders who have the ability to understand and initiate
                    action on matters of social justice.
