                <br>
                <p>Samjho Toh Express is an initiative by Community – The Youth Collective and its forum members to
                    explore cross border friendships and engage young people on the issues of social inclusion in order
                    to build vibrant eco-systems across India to understand each other. The campaign has started in
                    November 2015 and will be aiming to explore cross border friendships beyond labels and stereotypes.

                    The campaign looks at amplifying, nurturing and evaluating the 5th Space concept and the planned
                    objectives will be promoting youth, young leaders and youth led organizations to engage on issues of
                    social exclusion, peace and non violence. It also aims at cultivating cross border friendships
                    through an experiential journey which will help the youth in reflecting and breaking the stereotypes
                    that they hold for other communities, genders, castes, religions, ethnic backgrounds etc. A journey
                    through this campaign will help in internalizing the need to understand the ‘other’. We strongly
                    feel that a space needs to be created where young people can come together leaving behind their
                    identities and make ‘friends beyond labels’.</p>
