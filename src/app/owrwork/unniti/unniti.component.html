                <h3>School On Wheels</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The objective of the project is to motivate children from slums, bustees and streets to get enrolled
                    in formal education spaces at the end of the program by developing in them an interest for learning
                    and school. The School on Wheels is a fully equipped bus that visits identified location and holds
                    classes using fun, innovative teaching methodologies to urge these children to begin their learning
                    journey. It aims to give them their first experience of formal learning. The project attempts to
                    take education to out of school. </p>
